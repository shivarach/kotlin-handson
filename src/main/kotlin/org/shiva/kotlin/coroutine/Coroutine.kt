/**
 * A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. It is conceptually similar to a thread,
 * in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code.
 * However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread
 * and resume in another one.
 *
 * Coroutines are very lightweight
 *
 * A suspend function can be called only from Coroutines - launch, async or runBlocking(use runBlocking only for tests)
